# Motivation
During freshman year when I was doing programming asssignments for various computer science classes. Working in terminal became like a new home to me. I was constantly using it to finish my homework. However, I was also a fan of korean dramas and alt tabbing, navigating to viki.com, and then clicking around just to check if the latest episodes were done being subbed was beginning to take its toll on my efficiency. So I utliized their api to grab the json formatted subtitle statuses of their show.

# Usage
`java vikiParse [show] [episode] [threshold]`
